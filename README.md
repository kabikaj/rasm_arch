Rasm_arch is a text processing utility for converting Arabic-scripted text to a completely dediacritised skeleton. If Quranic indexes are given, it can also retrieve Quranic text.

A minimal Rust implementation can be found under src.

## Requirements

importlib-metadata>=6.6.0 \
ujson>=5.1.0

If ujson is not installed, json will be used.

## Installation

Install rasm_arch package and rasm_arch command-line utility through pip:

```sh
$ python -m pip install rasm_arch
```

Install rasm_arch package and rasm_arch command-line utility along with the man page locally using the makefile:

```sh
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
OR
$ make
```

Or simply install the man page manually:
```sh
$ sudo cp man/rasm_arch.1 /usr/share/man/man1/rasm_arch.1
$ sudo gzip -f /usr/share/man/man1/rasm_arch.1
$ mandb
``` 

Use the following commands to uninstall it:

```sh
$ pip uninstall rasm_arch
```

or

```sh
$ python setup.py install --record files.txt
$ xargs rm -rf < files.txt
```

## Examples of usage

In python:

```sh
>>> import io
>>> from rasm_arch import rasm_arch as rasm
>>> for ori, rlt, rar, pal in rasm(io.StringIO('کُتِب'), paleo=True):
...   print(ori, rlt, rar, pal)
کُتِب KBB كٮٮ KᵘB²ᵢB₁

```

```sh
>>> import io
>>> from rasm_arch import rasm_arch as rasm
>>> for word, blocks in rasm(io.StringIO("فنار الإسكندرية"), blocks=True, paleo=True):
...   print(f"word = {word}")
...   for ori, rlt, rar, pal in blocks:
...     print("--", ori, rlt, rar, pal)
word = فنار
-- فنا FBA ڡٮا F¹B¹A
-- ر R ر R
word = الإسكندرية
-- ا A ا A
-- لإ LA لا LAɂ
-- سكند SKBD سكٮد SKB¹D
-- ر R ر R
-- ية BH ٮه B₂H²
```

In python with Quran indexes as input:

```sh
>>> import io
>>> from rasm_arch import rasm_arch as rasm
>>> for word, blocks in rasm(((2, 14,15, None), (2, 15, 1, 1)), paleo=True, blocks=True):
...   print(word, *blocks[0], sep='\t')
...   if len(blocks)>1:
...     for block in blocks[1:]:
...         print('-', *block, sep='\t')
نَحۡنُ      نَحۡنُ    BGN   ٮحں   B¹ᵃGᵒN¹ᵘ       (2, 14, 15, 1)
مُسۡتَهۡزِءُونَ مُسۡتَهۡزِءُ MSBHR مسٮهر MᵘSᵒB²ᵃHᵒR¹ᵢʔᵘ (2, 14, 16, 1)
-        و      W     و     W              (2, 14, 16, 2)
-        نَ      N     ں     N¹ᵃ            (2, 14, 16, 3)
ٱ        ٱ      A     ا     Aᵟ              (2, 15, 1, 1)
```

As a command-line utility:

```sh
>>> aspell -d ar dump master | rasm-arch | tail -2
يين  BBN  ٮٮں
ييئس BBBS ٮٮٮس
```

```sh
>>> rasm-arch -q 2:286:35-2:286:36 --json | jq .
[
  {
    "ori": "لَا",
    "rlt": "LA",
    "rar": "لا",
    "ind": [
      2,
      286,
      35
    ]
  },
  {
    "ori": "طَاقَةَ",
    "rlt": "TAFH",
    "rar": "طاڡه",
    "ind": [
      2,
      286,
      36
    ]
  }
]
```

## License for the data

Rasm_arch includes two digitised Quranic texts: The Decotype Quran and the Tanzil Quran.

### Decotype Quran

The Decotype Quran is the best encoded Quran with complete orthography and the only digital Quran that has been used to render a printed Quran approved by Al-Azhar.

The Decotype Quran is private.

### Tanzil Quran

The Tanzil Quran is the most widely used digital Quran. It was made available by the Tanzil project, https://tanzil.net.

We have included two versions of the Tanzil Quran text:
- A complete Uthmanic Quran
- A simplified Quran
